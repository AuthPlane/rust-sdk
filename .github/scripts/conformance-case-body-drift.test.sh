# Tests for conformance-case-body-drift.sh and conformance-registered-case-ids.sh.
#
# Both scripts run only on the weekly drift schedule, so a break in either
# surfaces late and quietly — and the way it surfaces is a green run, because
# what they guard against is a check that under-reports. Shellcheck cannot see
# that class at all: a loosened id regex that silently drops cases, or a `diff`
# whose exit code stops being read, is valid shell. These tests pin the
# behaviour instead, so such an edit fails at PR time rather than the next time
# the catalog is re-tightened in place.
#
# The headline case is the real one the drift check exists for: the metadata
# jwks_uri rotation case was re-tightened under an unchanged id between two
# catalog revisions. The fixtures carry a trimmed form of both wordings, so the
# suite asserts against the change that actually happened rather than an
# invented one.
#
# Every fixture is a handful of YAML and JSON written to a temp dir. Nothing
# here clones the catalog, builds the workspace, or runs the conformance suite —
# the point is that these controls stay runnable and fast on a PR. That is also
# why the id extractor is a binary that writes a report and
# conformance-registered-case-ids.sh only reads one: the split is what lets the
# guards below run against fixture reports with no toolchain at all.

# re-tightening that replaced it under the same id. Trimmed to the keys that
# carry the change — surface, requirement_summary, stimulus, rationale — because
# the point of the fixture is the shape of the edit, not its length.
#
# standards_in_scope is present on purpose. It holds `- id:` entries that are
# not cases, and a fixture without it would not exercise the scoping that keeps

# mid-write leaves a truncated one, and a step that never ran leaves none. None
