# Fetch the conformance catalog at the revision this repo pins.
#
# Generic: nothing here is specific to one workflow or one caller's layout.
# Every workflow in this repo that needs the pinned catalog runs this one
# script, so a guard tightened here is tightened for all of them.
#
# The catalog lives in github.com/AuthPlane/conformance — a public repo, updated
# independently of this one — so cloning its default branch would let a catalog
# change turn an unrelated PR red here. The ref is pinned instead, single-sourced
# from the tracked .conformance-catalog-ref at the repo root: bump it when
# adopting new catalog cases, together with the coverage for them, so a catalog
# change can never break CI on its own.
#
# This script exists because the read/guard/fetch sequence is needed by more than
# one workflow. Kept inline in each, the guard could be tightened in one and not
# the others; the pin would be single-sourced but the logic reading it would not.
#
# Clones into $RUNNER_TEMP — outside $GITHUB_WORKSPACE — so the catalog stays out
# of the working tree: it must never be picked up by this repo's own build, test
# or coverage tooling, and `git add -A` in the release commit must never stage it
# as an embedded gitlink.
#
# Plain git over HTTPS is enough: the repo is public and read-only here, so there
# is no token to plumb and no third-party action surface to SHA-pin.
#
# Requires: GITHUB_WORKSPACE, RUNNER_TEMP.
#
# Optional: CONFORMANCE_CATALOG_DEST overrides the clone directory. A caller that
# needs the pinned catalog and the catalog tip side by side in the same job
# cannot let both land on the default path. Every other caller leaves it unset
# and gets $RUNNER_TEMP/conformance. It must be an absolute path outside
# $GITHUB_WORKSPACE: the out-of-tree rule above holds for every destination, not
# only the default, and is enforced below rather than left to the caller.
